I am having trouble with the heroku site. If you open up the dev tools, you'll see the error. 
My main component is rendering the first component; it doesn't like the path with params ('/albums/1').
This leads me to believe that it's a heroku/webpack thing. Maybe there is a way to tweak the code for it to work. 
Or maybe it's something else.

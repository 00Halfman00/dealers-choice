I am having trouble with the heroku site. If you open up the dev tools, you'll see the error. 
My main component is rendering the first component,
it seems not to like having an expression, which does work on the browser. 
This leads me to believe that it's a heroku/webpack thing. Maybe there is a way to tweak the code for it to work. 
Or maybe it's something else.
